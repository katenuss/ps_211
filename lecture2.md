# Updates & Reminders

:: content ::

- The ==pre-course survey== (linked on Slack in "general") is due by **Friday, Sep. 5** for a bonus point on the first exam.
  - Please fill this out! It will help us tailor the course to all students' backgrounds, and provide a dataset for us to analyze together.

<p v-click>

- You should be working on having ==R and R Studio== installed on your personal computer.
  - If you have not yet successfully installed them, please follow the instructions on Slack and come to office hours if you need help.

# Review: Types of Variables

:: content ::
- **Continuous variables**
  - Quantitative only
  - Any value within a range; can have fractions (e.g., height, weight)

- **Discrete variables**
  - Quantitative or qualitative
  - Only specific values; no fractions (e.g., number of pets)

- **Ordinal**: rankings with order, but no fractions (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd place)

# What is an experiment?

:: content ::

## An ==experiment== is a study in which independent variable(s) are manipulated to examine their effect on dependent variable(s).

- Involves *changing* or *manipulating* something
- Goal is to determine *causal* relations
- Requires *controlled* conditions

# Defining variables

:: content ::

## Variables must be defined. 
- Some are easy to define and measure: Year, height, age, etc.
- Some are harder: Happiness, anxiety, intelligence, etc.

<br>

## ==Levels==: Values that a variable can take on.
- Discrete variable example: "Type of pet" has levels "dog", "cat", "hamster", etc.
- Continuous variable example: "Reaction time" has levels from 0 to infinity.

# Non-experimental research: Correlational studies

:: left ::

## Correlational studies: Observe variables as they naturally occur to see if they are related.
- Useful for demonstrating relationships between variables.
- Cannot determine causality.
- Example: Surveying people about their exercise habits and mental health to see if they are related.

  </div>
</div>

**Answer:** Correlational studies are useful for identifying relationships between variables and can provide insights for further research. They are often easier and less expensive to conduct than experimental studies. Sometimes, they are the only ethical (or possible!) option.

# Correlational vs. experimental study

- **Correlational study:**

# Practice: Identifying Confounds

:: left ::

- Researchers decide to manipulate exercise (IV) to see if it affects mood (DV). 
- They assign 10 college students to a high-exercise group (jogging 5 times a week) and 10 to a low-exercise group (no exercise). 
- After 4 weeks, they measure mood using a questionnaire. 
- They then find that students in the high-exercise group report better moods than the low-exercise group. 
- The researchers conclude that exercise improves mood.

<p v-click>
<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-1 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-1 transform">
    What is one potential confound in this experiment that may undermine this conclusion?
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** There are many! Over the four weeks, the high-exercise group may have had:
- better moods to begin with.
- more social interaction over the four weeks.
- more exposure to sunlight.

</p>

<p v-click>
<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">

    What else could have gone wrong in this experiment?
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** The manipulation may not have worked. Maybe the low-exercise group actually exercised more than the high-exercise group!

# Reliability and Validity

:: content ::
### **Reliability**: consistency across repeated measures  

<br>

### **Validity**: measuring what it’s supposed to measure 

<br>

### Examples:  
- A *reliable* scale gives the same weight each time.
- A *valid* scale gives the true weight.

## Valid but not reliable?

- A measure can't measure what it's supposed to measure if it gives different results each time.

# Experimental Example: The Stroop Task

<p v-click>

- The Stroop Task is used to study how well people can suppress interference from "automatic" cognitve processes (like reading).
  - This is an important aspects of what's commonly referred to as "cognitive control." 
</p>

<p v-click>

- Participants see color words (e.g., "red", "blue", "green") printed in different colors and must name the ink color as quickly as possible.
- Two conditions:
  - **Congruent**: word meaning matches ink color (e.g., "red" in red ink)
  - **Incongruent**: word meaning does not match ink color (e.g., "red" in blue ink)

</p>

<p v-click>

- Researchers measure reaction times (RTs) for naming the ink color in both conditions.

# Between- vs. Within-Subjects: Practice

:: left ::

A researcher wants to see if children and adolescents show reduced Stroop interference compared to adults. She recruits 20 children, 20 adolescents, and 20 adults. Each participant completes both the congruent and incongruent Stroop tasks, and the researcher measures their reaction times (RTs) for each condition.

:: right ::

<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-1 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-1 transform">
    Is this a between-subjects or within-subjects design?
  </div>
</div>

<p v-click>

**Answer**: Trick question! This design is *mixed.* The age group (children, adolescents, adults) is a between-subjects variable, while the Stroop condition (congruent vs. incongruent) is a within-subjects variable.

</p>

<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-1 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-1 transform">
    What are the IVs and what are their levels?
  </div>
</div>

<p v-click>

**Answer**: There are two IVs:
1. Age group (between-subjects): Levels = children, adolescents, adults
2. Stroop condition (within-subjects): Levels = congruent, incongruent

# Putting concepts together: Practice

:: left ::

<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-1 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-1 transform">
    In this study, is age group a discrete or continuous variable?
  </div>
</div>

<p v-click>

**Answer**: Discrete. Age group is categorical (children vs. adults).

</p>

<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-1 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-1 transform">
    In this study, is age group a nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio variable?
  </div>
</div>

<p v-click>

**Answer**: Ordinal. Age group has an inherent order (children are younger than adults), but the difference between groups is not necessarily equal.

</p>


:: right ::

<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-1 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-1 transform">
    How could you change the design to make age a continuous variable?
  </div>
</div>

<p v-click>

**Answer**: You could measure the exact age of each participant (in years) instead of categorizing them into groups (children, adolescents, adults).

</p>

<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-1 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-1 transform">
    Is this a correlational or experimental study?
  </div>
</div>

<p v-click>

**Answer**: Both! The researcher manipulates one of the independent variables (Stroop condition) to observe its effect on the dependent variable (reaction times). However, age group is a naturally occurring variable that is not manipulated, making it correlational in that respect.
