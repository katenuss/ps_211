<p v-click>

- We will use **Slack** for class communication. Everyone should be added. Please reach out to Kate or Juneau if you are not yet on the Slack workspace.

</p>

<p v-click>

- Please check Slack regularly for important announcements. 

</p>

<p v-click>

- Please also use the Slack to ask questions about course material!

    - In general, our policy is that if you ask us a question about course material, we will publicly post it (anonymously, if you desire) and the answer on Slack, so that everyone can benefit from the learning opportunity.

</p>

<p v-click>

- That said, our hope is that you will take advantage of lecture, discussion, and office hours to ask questions **IN PERSON**. If you send us a content-based question via email or slack, we may ask you to come to office hours or ask during lecture/discussion instead.

# Class Policies: Collaboration and Use of Artificial Intelligence

:: content ::

**Collaboration is a huge part of science. Learning how to collaborate effectively is an important skill.**
- As such, you are allowed to ask each other for help on homework assignments and data write-ups.
- However, you must each submit your own work. Copying someone else’s work is plagiarism. 

<p v-click>

<br> 

**You may also use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to help you with your code.**
- However, use them cautiously. They can be wrong! 
- In addition, remember that you will need to understand the statistical concepts, as you will complete the exams on your own without any help.

</p>

<p v-click>

*There will be a place on the assignment to acknowledge your collaborators and any AI tools you used. You will not be penalized for collaboration or use of AI if you disclose it honestly.*

# The scientific method

:: content ::

#### 1. Make an observation
- Notice something in the world. 
- Observations can arise from experience, introspection, or reading prior research.

#### 2. Research existing literature 
- Review prior research to see what is already known about the topic.
- Identify gaps in knowledge or areas for further investigation.

#### 3. Develop your hypothesis
- Formulate a testable prediction about the relationship between variables.
- In general, good hypotheses are specific and falsifiable.

==Example: "Increased study time will lead to higher exam scores."==

# The scientific method (cont.)

:: content ::

#### 4. Design your study
- Decide how to test your hypothesis.
- Choose a research method (e.g., experiment, survey, observational study).
- Identify your variables (independent, dependent, control).

#### 5. Collect and analyze data
- Gather data according to your study design.
- Use statistical methods to analyze the data and test your hypothesis.
- Determine whether the results support or refute your hypothesis.

#### 6. Draw conclusions and communicate results
- Interpret the results in the context of your hypothesis and existing literature.
- Share your findings through reports, presentations, or publications.

# The scientific publication process

:: left ::
- Once studies are completed, scientists write up their findings in a manuscript.
- Manuscripts are submitted to peer-reviewed journals.
- Other scientists in the field review the manuscript and provide feedback.

# The scientific publication process (cont.)

:: left ::
- Authors almost always need to revise their manuscript based on this feedback.
- If the manuscript meets the journal's standards, it is published and becomes part of the scientific literature.
- This is important because it enables other scientists to evaluate, replicate, and build upon the findings.

==Caveat: Not all published research is useful AND not all useful research is published in traditional journals.==

# Why do scientific papers always include statistics?

:: content ::

# Two types of statistics

<br>

## 1. Descriptive statistics
- Organize, summarize, and communicate numerical information. 

## 2. Inferential statistics
- Use sample data to make inferences about a larger population.
- Enable descriptions, predictions, and explanations to be generalized beyond the specific data collected.

# Populations and samples

:: content ::

## Populations
- The entire group of individuals or items that you want to draw conclusions about.
- Examples: All rats in the world, all adults in the U.S., all students at BU, all voters in an election.

<br>

### The problem:
- We usually cannot collect data from an entire population.
- Example: Leading up to elections, we cannot ask every single voter who they plan to vote for.


---
layout: top-title
color: indigo-light
align: lt
---

:: title ::
# Populations and samples (cont.)

:: content ::

## The solution: Samples
- A subset of individuals or items selected from a population.
- Examples: 100 rats from a lab, 1,000 adults surveyed in the U.S., 200 students at BU, 500 voters polled in an election.

### Goal:
- Use data from a representative sample to make inferences about the larger population.
- This is where ==inferential statistics== come in!

<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">

    Do you think the research behind this number is based on a sample or a population? Explain.
  </div>
</div>

**Answer:** Sample. It would be nearly impossible to survey every single person in the world. Instead, researchers likely surveyed a representative sample of people and used inferential statistics to estimate the total number of people with depression worldwide.

    Is 300 million a descriptive or inferential statistic? Explain.
  </div>
</div>

**Answer:** Inferential statistic. This number is an estimate based on data from a sample, rather than a direct measurement of the entire population.

# Transforming observations into variables

:: content ::

## Variable
- Any observation that can take on different values.
- Research process begins by transforming observations into variables.

<br>

### Examples of variables in psychology:
- Responses to surveys or questionnaires (e.g., depression scores, personality traits).
- Behavioral observations (e.g., number of times a rat presses a lever, time spent on a task).
- Physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate, brain activity).

<br>

==Note: Variables vary. They take on different values.==

# Different types of variables

:: content ::

## Qualitative
- Differ in quality (meaning character or kind) not quantity.
- Also called a 'nominal' variable.
- Examples: hair color, gender, species.

## Quantitative
- Differ in quantity (meaning amount or number).
- Examples: height, weight, age.

# Types of discrete variables

:: left ::

## Nominal variables
- Used for labeling variables without any quantitative value.
- You can assign numbers to these variables, but the numbers do not have any mathematical meaning.
- Examples: hair color, gender, species.

## Ordinal variables
- Used for labeling variables with a meaningful order or ranking.
- The intervals between the ranks may not be equal.
- No fractions or decimals.
- Examples: class rank, satisfaction ratings (e.g., 1-5 stars).

## Interval variables
- Used for labeling variables where the intervals between values are meaningful and equal.
- No true zero point (i.e., zero does not indicate the absence of the quantity being measured).

## Ratio variables
- Interval variables with a true zero point (i.e., absence of the quantity being measured).

You are not sure if you want to take this class, so you design an experiment to see if BU students who take PS 211 are generally happier than students who do not take PS 211. To do this, you email 200 students who took PS 211 last year and 200 students who did not take PS 211 last year. 150 students in each group respond to your email. You collect the following data: 
1. Whether or not the student took PS 211 (Yes/No).
2. The student's happiness score (rated on a scale from 1 to 10).
3. The student's major (e.g., Psychology, Biology, Engineering).
