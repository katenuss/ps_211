# Subcategories of variables

:: left ::

## Continuous (quantitative)
- Can assume any value within a range.

## Discrete (quantitative or qualitative)
- Can only take on specific values.

# Types of discrete variables

:: left ::

## Nominal variables
- Used for labeling variables without any quantitative value.
- You can assign numbers to these variables, but the numbers do not have any mathematical meaning.
- Examples: hair color, gender, species.

:: right ::

## Ordinal variables
- Used for labeling variables with a meaningful order or ranking.
- The intervals between the ranks may not be equal.
- No fractions or decimals.
- Examples: class rank, satisfaction ratings (e.g., 1-5 stars).

# Types of continuous (or discrete) variables

## Interval variables
- Used for labeling variables where the intervals between values are meaningful and equal.
- No true zero point (i.e., zero does not indicate the absence of the quantity being measured).

## Ratio variables
- Interval variables with a true zero point (i.e., absence of the quantity being measured).

You conduct a survey of college students to understand how demographics relate to academic performance. You collect the following data:
1. Number of hours spent studying per week.
2. Age.
3. Gender identity.
4. Number of questions answered correctly on a math test.
5. Number of courses taken this semester.
6. Amount of money in their bank account.

# Reliability and Validity

:: content ::
### **Reliability**: consistency across repeated measures  

<br>

### **Validity**: measuring what it’s supposed to measure 

<br>

### Examples:  
- A *reliable* scale gives the same weight each time.
- A *valid* scale gives the true weight.

## Reliable but not valid? 
- Yes! A broken scale that always reads 5 lbs too heavy is reliable (consistent) but not valid (not accurate).
- Yes! An IQ test may give you the same score each time (reliable) but not actually measure intelligence (valid).

## Valid but not reliable? 
- No! If a measure is not consistent, it cannot be valid because it cannot be accurate.
- A measure can't measure what it's supposed to measure if it gives different results each time.
- Example: A scale that gives different weights each time is neither reliable nor valid.

# Reliability and Validity: Practice

:: content ::

*A researcher wants to measure stress levels in college students. They develop a new questionnaire that asks about various stress-related symptoms. They administer the questionnaire to a group of students and find that the results are consistent when the same students take the test multiple times. However, when they compare the questionnaire results to physiological measures of stress (like cortisol levels), they find no correlation.*

<div class="mt-1 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-2 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 transform">
    How would you describe the reliability and validity of this new questionnaire?
  </div>
</div>

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** The questionnaire is reliable because it produces consistent results when the same students take it multiple times. However, it is not valid because it does not correlate with physiological measures of stress, indicating that it may not be accurately measuring stress levels.

    What evidence would you use to support your argument?
  </div>
</div>

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** You could point to studies showing that SAT scores can vary significantly for the same individual when taken multiple times (indicating low reliability). Additionally, you could cite research showing that SAT scores do not strongly correlate with other measures of intelligence, such as IQ tests or academic performance (indicating low validity).

# Operational definitions: Needed to test hypotheses

:: content ::
- **Operational definitions**: Specify the observations or procedures used to measure or manipulate a variable.
  - Example: Happiness could be operationally defined as "self-reported happiness on a 1-10 scale" or "number of smiles in a 5-minute video""

# Histograms

:: content ::
- Graphs are often more effective than tables for seeing patterns in data.
- A **histogram** is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency table.
- The x-axis shows the intervals (or "bins") of continuous values.
- The y-axis shows the frequency (or count) of observations in each interval.

# Histograms (Continued)

:: content ::

- A histogram *looks* like a bar graph, but **the y-axis always represents frequency or count**, not a separate variable.

# Skew

:: content ::
- When data are not symmetrically distributed, we say they are **skewed**.
- The ends of the distribution are called the =="tails."==
- **Positively skewed** (or right-skewed) distributions have a long tail on the right side.
- **Negatively skewed** (or left-skewed) distributions have a long tail on the left side.

:: title ::
# Positive skew and floor effects

:: content ::
- **Positive skew**: The ==tail== of the distribution extends to the right.
- Sometimes a positive skew can indicate a **floor effect**. ==Not always!!==
- A **floor effect** occurs when a large number of observations cluster at the lower end of the scale, with few observations at the higher end.

- Outliers are extreme values that differ greatly from the rest of the data.

# Review: Variance

:: content ::

**Why do we care about variance and standard deviations?**

- Variance and standard deviations tell us how **spread out** scores are around the mean.
- They are used in many statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).
- They are also useful in the real world!

  Now imagine that you need to estimate the standard deviation of the weights of the 100 people. You decide to randomly poll 10 of the 100 and ask their weights. How would you use the weights of the 10 people to estimate the standard deviation of the weights of all 100 people?
  </div>
</div>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** Calculate the standard deviation of the 10 weights (your sample) and use that as an estimate of the standard deviation of all 100 weights (your population).

</p>

<p v-click>

**Let's do it:** 
Here are your sample weights (in lbs): $120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210$

</p>

<p v-click>

**Step 1:** Calculate the mean of the weights.

$M = (120 + 130 + 140 + 150 + 160 + 170 + 180 + 190 + 200 + 210) / 10 = 165$

</p>

<p v-click>

**Step 2:** Calculate the sum of squared deviations from the mean.
$$ \sum (X_i - M)^2 = (120-165)^2 + (130-165)^2 + (140-165)^2 ...  + (210-165)^2 = 8250 $$

**Step 3:** Calculate the *sample* variance.
$$ Variance = \frac{\sum (X_i - M)^2}{n-1} = \frac{8250}{10-1} = 916.67 $$
</p>

<p v-click>

**Step 4:** Calculate the *sample* standard deviation.
$$ SD = \sqrt{Variance} = \sqrt{916.67} \approx 30.28 $$

</p>

<p v-click>

Now we have our *sample* standard deviation of 30.28 lbs, which we can use as an estimate of the *population* standard deviation of all 100 weights.

# Hypothesis Testing

:: content ::
- In psychological research, we define two hypotheses:
    - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no difference.
        - The null hypothesis is a statement that postulates that there is no difference between populations or that the difference is in a direction opposite of that anticipated by the researcher.
        - Any observed difference is due to random chance or sampling error.


    - **Research Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a difference.
        - There is a difference between populations or sometimes, more specifically, that there is a difference in a certain direction, positive or negative; also called an alternative hypothesis.
        - An observed difference reflects a true effect in the population.
    
- ==Goal: Use data to test which is more plausible.==
