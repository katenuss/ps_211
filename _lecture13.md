# Reporting Results in APA Style

:: content ::
APA style tells us **how to clearly report statistics** so others can understand and replicate our work.  
It ensures clarity and consistency across psychology and related sciences.

# What is APA Style?

:: content ::

- **APA** = *American Psychological Association*  
- A standardized format for writing and reporting scientific results  
- Ensures clarity, transparency, and consistency across research papers  

<div class="mt-4 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-3 rounded">

**APA style guides how we:**  
‚Ä¢ write numbers and statistics  
‚Ä¢ report results of tests (*t*, *z*, *F*, etc.)  
‚Ä¢ format p-values, CIs, and effect sizes  
</div>

# Why Use APA Style?

:: content ::
- Helps readers quickly interpret results.  
- Makes research **replicable** and **comparable**.  
- Prevents ambiguity ‚Äî everyone reports in the same format. 
- Required by most psychology journals and conferences. 

<div class="mt-3 italic text-gray-700">
Think of APA as the ‚Äúgrammar rules‚Äù of scientific writing.

# Always Include These Elements

:: content ::
| Element | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Test statistic** | Which test you ran (*t*, *z*, *F*) | *t* |
| **Degrees of freedom (df)** | Indicates sample size info | *t*(28)|
| **Test value** | The computed statistic | *t*(28) = 2.45 |
| **p value** | Probability under H‚ÇÄ | *p* = .004 or *p* < .001 |
| **Descriptive stats** | Means, SDs for each group | *M* = 5.3, *SD* = 1.2 |

‚úÖ These should appear in **every** statistical report.

# Technically optional (but strongly recommended)

:: content ::
| Element | Why Include It | Example |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Effect size** | Shows *magnitude* of difference | *d* = 0.68 |
| **Confidence interval (CI)** | Range of plausible values | 95% CI [0.12, 1.24] |
| **Exact p value** | More informative than *p* < .05 | *p* = .037 |

<div class="mt-3 text-gray-600">

- Including these helps readers understand *how strong* and *how precise* your findings are.
- Many journals now require effect sizes, CIs, and exact p-values.
- There is no reason *not* to include them!

# Reporting a *z* Test

:: content ::

**Template**

$M = X, \ SD = Y, \ z = Z, \ p = P, \ d = D,  \text{ 95\% CI [LL, UL]}$

**Example**

Students‚Äô average rent (*M* = $920, *SD* = $192) was significantly higher than the population mean of $500, *z* = 9.39, *p* < .001, *d* = 4.20, 95% CI \[$832, $1008].

‚úÖ No *degrees of freedom* are reported for *z* tests. *Z* tests are based on known population parameters, not sample estimates, so df are not applicable.

# Formatting Rules (APA 7th Edition)

:: content ::
- Italicize *t*, *z*, *p*, *M*, *SD*, *F*, *r*  
- Use **two decimal places** for statistics (except *p*)  
- Report *p* values as:
  - *p* = .042 (no leading zero)
  - *p* < .001 (for very small values)
- Match decimal precision across CIs and descriptive stats

# APA Reporting: Practice üß†

:: content ::
**Rewrite each in APA style:**

1. The Caffeine group got an average of 14.2 right answers (standard deviation = 3), and the Placebo group got 11.1 right answers (SD 2.8). The difference was statistically significant with t = 3.2 and p=0.004, df = 28. The Effect size was D= 0.79 and 95 percent CI = (0.50 TO 4.80).

2. Participants slept on average 7.6 Hours (s.d.=0.8) which was not significantly different from the national Mean of 7.5. The T test was not significant (P = .66; t = .45; DF=19). Cohen‚Äôs D = 0.06 and the 95% confidence interval was (-0.42 , 0.62).

# Practice: Answers 

::content ::
Below are the **APA-corrected versions** of those two messy examples.

#### ‚òïÔ∏è Correct Example 1 ‚Äî Independent-Samples *t*

> The caffeine group (*M* = 14.2, *SD* = 3.0) scored higher than the placebo group (*M* = 11.1, *SD* = 2.8),  
> *t*(28) = 3.20, *p* = .004, *d* = 0.79, 95% CI \[0.50, 4.80].

*What was fixed?*
- Italicize statistical symbols (*t*, *p*, *d*, *M*, *SD*).  
- Report *t*(df) = value, *p*, *d*, and 95% CI in this order.  
- Use brackets for the CI and **no leading zeros** for *p* values less than 1.

#### üò¥ Correct Example 2 ‚Äî One-Sample *t*

> Participants slept an average of 7.6 hours (*SD* = 0.8), which did not differ significantly from the national mean of 7.5,  
> *t*(19) = 0.45, *p* = .66, *d* = 0.06, 95% CI \[‚àí0.42, 0.62].

*What was fixed?*
- Write numbers and units clearly (‚Äú7.6 hours‚Äù).  
- Keep *p* = .66 (not *P* = 0.66).  
- Report CI in brackets.
