# Updates and reminders

:: content ::

- Homework 1 is due (via Blackboard) on Monday, September 15 at 11:59 PM.
    - Homework 1 mostly covers material from Lectures 1 - 3, with a small amount of material from today's lecture.
- Exam 1 is scheduled for Tuesday, September 23 during our regular class time.
    - Exam 1 will cover material from Lectures 1 - 4.
    - After today's lecture, I will post a review sheet on Slack that has all the topics that will be covered on the exam.
    - The exam will be closed book/notes, but you may print the provided review sheet (and write on it with your own notes) or you may bring one 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper with handwritten notes (both sides).
    - You will be able to complete the exam without a calculator. However, you are welcome to bring a calculator if you would like. Phones and phone calculators are not allowed.
- If you have accommodations, Juneau will reach out to you (via Slack) to confirm your accommodations for the exam. If you do not hear from Juneau by the end of the day, please contact both of us.
- If you need to miss the exam for any reason, please contact me as soon as possible to schedule a makeup exam.
    - Make-ups must be taken within one week of the original exam date.
- We will have a review session for Exam 1 on Thursday, September 18 during our regular class time.

# Central Tendency

:: content ::
- Central tendency describes the “center” of a dataset.  
- It identifies the value that scores cluster around.  
- The three common measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.

# The Mean

:: content ::
- The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset.  
- It is calculated by adding all scores together and dividing by the number of scores.  
- The mean balances the distribution, like a fulcrum.

:: title ::
# The Median

:: content ::
- The median is the middle score when all scores are ordered from lowest to highest.  
- If there is an even number of scores, the median is the average of the two middle scores.  
- The median represents the 50th percentile of the data.

:: title ::
# The Mode

:: content ::
- The mode is the most common score in the dataset.  
- A distribution may be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), or multimodal (many modes).  
- The mode is not always useful if many values occur with the same frequency.

# Comparing Mean, Median, and Mode

:: content ::
- In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal.  
- In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode.  
- In a positively skewed distribution, the mode is less than the median, which is less than the mean.

# Outliers

:: content ::
- Outliers are extreme values that differ greatly from the rest of the data.  
- Outliers can distort the mean, making it less representative of the dataset.  
- The median is less affected by outliers and can be a better measure of central tendency in skewed data.

# Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Statistics

:: content ::
- Parametric tests are powerful but assume normality, equal variance, independence, and no extreme outliers.  
- Non-parametric tests do not require these assumptions and are often used with ordinal data.  
- Non-parametric tests are less powerful but still useful when assumptions are not met.

### Lecture 4: Variability

# Variability

:: content ::
- Variability describes how spread out the scores in a distribution are.  
- The three common measures are range, variance, and standard deviation.  
- Distributions with higher variability show greater spread between scores.

# Range

:: content ::
- The range is the difference between the highest and lowest score.  
- For example, if the highest quiz score is 90 and the lowest is 70, the range is 20.  
- The range is simple to compute, but it only depends on two scores and can be distorted by outliers.

# Interquartile Range

:: content ::
- The interquartile range (IQR) measures the distance between the 25th percentile (Q1) and 75th percentile (Q3).  
- The IQR represents the middle 50% of the data.  
- Because it is less influenced by outliers, the IQR is often a more robust measure of variability.

# Variance

:: content ::
- Variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.  
- Squaring the deviations prevents them from canceling out.  
- A larger variance means scores are more spread out.  
- Variance is expressed in squared units, which can be harder to interpret directly.

:: title ::
# Standard Deviation

:: content ::
- The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.  
- It represents the typical amount that each score deviates from the mean.  
- Larger standard deviations indicate greater spread, while smaller ones indicate that scores cluster more closely around the mean.

# Variability in SPSS

:: content ::
- In SPSS, descriptive statistics can be used to compute range, variance, and standard deviation.  
- These values appear in the output window and provide a quick summary of variability in your dataset.
